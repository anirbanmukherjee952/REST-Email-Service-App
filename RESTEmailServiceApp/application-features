Application features:
=====================

1. RESTful API: 
	>> REST stands for REpresentation State Transform 
	>> API stands for Application Programmer Interface
	
	>> Controller will not return view anymore!
	>> Controller will only return "data"
	>> Representation of the "data":
		1. JSON or JavaScript Object Notation
		2. XML
	
	>> WHY RESTful API?
	Any web application has two parts: front-end and back-end
	front-end: view
	back-end: controller
	Typical MVC pattern does this:
	-> binds front-end with back-end; then what's the problem?
	-> better UI/UX
